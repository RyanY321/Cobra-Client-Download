                <h1>Project Cobra Client</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">Every code starts with a project name, our project was code name: "Cobra Client", this project was supposed to be only sent out to friends and this project was suppsoed to be sent out as a little fun program to be used to mess around with until someone in the group "Ryan" has sent out an idea to send out the program to everyone and make a website, at the time he was just new to HTML5 and CSS, and he wsas the only one who knew most of what he was doing with HTML5 and CSS so we was the one set out to do all of the web development for Cobra Client while "Cobra" tries to send to the beta of the program to more people but he was also trying to find people to join the Cobra Client Group so that we could crowd source with other people to help make Cobra Client a brand new program for launch.</p>
                <hr>

                <h1>The Struggle Of Cobra Client</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">as "Ryan" was working on some code for Cobra Client one night taking a break from the Website Code for a little bit of time he sent a panic message to "Cobra" telling him that we are going to need to do a little bit of a recode of the program and I can do that for you, you just find more people while I code the new code for the program, everything is broken. At that moment we all knew that we had messed up and that the compiled code at the time which is just in one text file had failed due to too much happening and the program being harder to read with all the new features. Something had to be done about the one text file and it ended up turning into a few folders and files once "Ryan" was done coding the program rewrite.</p>
                <hr>

                <h1>Website issues</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 25px;">As you can see we have fixed the issues with the website, the website one day broke and didn't work in the testing and "Ryan", the one coding the website at the time we freaking out thinking about what he could've done but nothing worked so he decided to recode the website one page at a time hoping that it would all be fixed, he mainly did a copy and paste motive for big text and he recoded in 10 hours, the website was fixed.</p>
