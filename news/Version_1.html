        <h1>Newsletter!</h1>
        <p class="Newsletter-V1">The updates and changes that have been taken place in the Cobra Client Version 1.0 are that we have added Desktop Goose Program built into Cobra Client for using Desktop Goose safely without any worry of getting a virus with the program as we have made a few edits to the Desktop Goose's Source Code to ensure the safety of all of our users.</p>
        <p class="Newsletter-V1">We have also fixed a few bugs inside the software end of Cobra Client such as random crashes in the program and crashes while opening a menu in the program a few other bugs that we haev fixed inside of the program is headless mode not activating when sent the command by Cobra Client to activate. Another issue fixed with Headless Mode is when you try to exit the mode it will not exit. We have tried our best to fix that if anymore issues appear with headless mode report it immedately.</p>
        <p class="Newsletter-V1">Windows N.T. versions would also crash when opening the program in a Virtual Machine or when opening on Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 7, so we have tried our best to develop the program to work for Virutal Machines and to work for other Windows N.T. versions.</p>
        <p class="Newsletter-V1">IP tools got a huge bug fix with the new 1.0 update of Cobra Client, sometimes when opening the IP Lookup tool the program would not let you exit the mode or Windows Firewall would shut down the process of looking up the IP Address you are targeting (The owners of Cobra Client do not endorse DDoS or distubing of DDoS programs, these menus are purely for entertainment and information.) we have also fixed IP Address information status in the program, the informaiton wouled not show up or the information would be cut off, sometimes even the information would not show up or go to a different menu of the program.</p>
        <p class="Newsletter-V1">FInally the editing of the logs have been fixed, and the logs feature in Cobra Client have been updated to work better with Windows 11 N.T, some of the features were not working with Windows 11 and now are. All of our developers figured this out because they all moved to WIndows 11.
